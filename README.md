TicTacToe is console application project on C#.
I had written for my friend's school project.
There is a basic logic for game and here are some properties;

-The game has include 2 player (User and Computer)
-The computer can move randomly (when the game comes to computer)
-These moves are not smart,it can select empty coordinate, and plays
-Board can be resizable (for 3x3 , 5x5 and 7x7)
-The game can be saved (in .txt file with all infos)
-And when the game will start again ,user can load old game,and plays

That's all.
I am open to every kind of suggestion.

Thank you.
